## Belly Button Biodiversity Project

### Overview: 
In this mock project, our team helped a start-up company, Improbable Beef, research bacteria species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. One of the lead researchers believes the ideal bacteria to create synthetic beef comes from the human belly button. The lab team collected naval samples from human subjects across the U.S. Our team then displayed the data on a dashboard for Improbable Beef and the participants to look at the different bacterias of each participant.
